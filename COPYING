Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world confer
exclusive Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and owner(OWNERSHIP) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
It is important in that it is a personal identity.  Any person who was not involved in providing information in creating the work  The use of works without official written permission from the "owner" is considered to be a serious offense because it causes the owner's reputation and property to be seriously affected.  And the certificate is strictly not intended to attack the original owner...
Anyone who does such a thing does not include youth, students, and faculty at all levels.  Is it appropriate to secretly claim someone else's work as your own?  Which none of you have ever done that work before, just because you have read the article and became interested because others have successfully hacked it, so they greedily follow along and some businessmen testify.  Support in secret ways to commit fraud (considered fraud and a serious violation of ethics)...
Everyone who is doing this kind of thing is requested to stop doing it.  Don't make silly excuses on the sidelines because they don't make sense. If you really want to make them, go to the court of law.
